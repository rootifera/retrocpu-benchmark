## RetroCPU-Benchmark

A simple tool for benchmarking old CPU's under Win9x and MS-DOS.

Once you run the software it will ask how many times you want to run the tests. I usually run it for 3 times but that's all up to you. 

For Pentium 75 I think it takes about 10-15 minutes to finish a single run, so don't go crazy with the total run numbers.

At the end of the test you will get an overall benchmark score and individual scores for each run. There is nothing scientific about this test, it just calculates some numbers and tells you how fast your CPU can do it.

And as always, use with caution. Old CPU's can just burn and die if you can't cool them properly. Remember this beautiful beautiful video:

And if you kill some hardware, that's on you. I don't take any responsibility.
